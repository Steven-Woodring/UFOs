# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
### Creating a webpage with interactive visualizations of UFO sighting data

## Overview
The purpose of this website is to help a hypothetical data journalist, Dana, inform the public on historical UFO sightings. Due to the large number of reported sightings, the table of data on the website must have filtering functionality to allow users to sift through the information. Since Dana will be posting her alien article online, she needs a webpage that can display her write-up and data table in a tidy fashion.

## Results
### Using the Filter Functionality
In order to allow users to easily sift through the large UFO sightings dataset, the website has multi-filtering functionality. The page initially presents the full table of data next to the five available filters, each with their own placeholders to show users an acceptable input.

To filter the sightings table, the user must simply type in an acceptable input in one or more of the filter fields, then click anywhere on the page or press enter.

If the user wants to retract a filter, they can either refresh the page and start from scratch or delete their input in the filter field and click anywhere on the page or press enter.

## Summary
### Drawbacks
One drawback of the website’s design is that a user could potentially enter an unacceptable input. This could lead to user confusion as the page would not return any results in the data table.
### Recommendations for Further Development
To address the drawback above, the filtering functionality could be updated with data validation. In this case, as users type in any one of the filter fields, possible inputs would appear underneath the field, and the user could choose to autocomplete their filter.
Additionally, the website is still rather plain, and there are opportunities to further peak the user’s interest by attaching new formatting to the data table and filter fields.
